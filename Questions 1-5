Question 1 : Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.
.ForEach doesn't actually return anything, it simply calls the provided function on each element in the array.
 map also calls a provided function but returns values and creates a new array of the same size.


Question 2 : What is the difference between a function and a method?

A method is on an object and a function is independent of an object.


Question 3 : What is closure?

A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.


Question 4 : Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

New: If the new keyword is used when calling the funcion, this inside the function is a brand new object.
Explicit: If apply, call, or bind are used to call a function this inside a function is the object that is passed as the argument.
Implicit: If dot notation is used to invoke a function this is the object that the function is a property of.
Window: If a function is invoked without any of the above conditions then this is the global object, i.e. window in most cases.


Question 5 : Why do we need super() in an extended class?

It allows the object to access and call functions from the objects parents.
